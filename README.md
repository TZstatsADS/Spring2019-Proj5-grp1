+ Project summary: The dataset we used in this project is Fer2013 which including 7 kinds of emotions(0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).The images size are equal to 48*48 and they have already been transfomed to CSV.In addition, We mainly used three CNN models in the project(LeNets,advance model1,VGG16 with imagnet) and VGG16 is the one which has the best performance(around 35%). We hope this project can help you have a better understanding towards Convolutional Neural Netwoks and at the same, have more insights in facial expression recognition
